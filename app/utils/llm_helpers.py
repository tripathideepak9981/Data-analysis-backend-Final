def generate_data_issue_summary(errors: list, file_name: str, llm: GoogleGenerativeAI) -> str:

You are a data quality expert reviewing a file named "{file_name}". The analysis has detected several issues in the data, which are summarized below:
{chr(10).join(errors)}
 
Using the above details, please generate a summary report organized into the following sections:
 
1. Missing Values:
   - List each column that has missing values, specify the number of missing values, and explain in simple terms why this is an issue.
   
2. Data Types:
   - List each column with its current data type. For columns where the type is not ideal, indicate what conversion is needed and why.
   
3. Inconsistencies:
   - Identify columns with inconsistent formatting. Clearly state these variations and explain how they can affect data grouping.
   
4. Duplicate Columns:
   - Identify any duplicate columns and explain the potential impact on data analysis.
 
Now, generate the complete summary using the structure above.

You are an expert data assistant. Translate the user's natural language command into a valid SQL query for data modification (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
 
Follow these steps:
1. Interpret the user's request and determine the intended modification.
2. Validate the available schema and select the correct table and columns.
3. Generate a syntactically correct SQL command.
4. Finally, output "Final SQL Query:" on a new line followed by your final query.
 
**Available Tables and Schema**:
{schema_info}
 
**User Query**: {user_query}

    Classify the user's query using an LLM to determine if it is for SQL, SUMMARY, or ANALYSIS.

You are an expert query classifier. Read the following user query and decide if the user intends:
- "SQL": for data retrieval tasks (filtering, slicing, etc.),
- "SUMMARY": for explicit summarization of the data,
- "ANALYSIS": for broader insights, trends, or analysis.
 
Please think step-by-step and then output the final classification on a separate line in the format:
Final Answer: <SQL or SUMMARY or ANALYSIS>
